- Introduction to multiprocessing, `fork`, `waitpid`, `execvp`, process ids, inter-process communication, context switches, user versus supervisor mode.
- Protected address spaces, virtual memory, main memory as cache, virtual to physical address mapping.
- Concurrency versus parallelism, multiple cores versus multiple processors, concurrency issues with multiprocessing.
- Interrupts, faults, systems calls, signals, design and implementation of a simple shell.
- Virtualization as a general systems principle, with a discussion of processes, RAID, load balancers, AFS servers and clients.
